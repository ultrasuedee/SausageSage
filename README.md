**# Sausage Sage**

Sausage Sage is an Android application designed to help sausage makers calculate ingredient proportions and manage their recipes. 
Whether you're a professional butcher or a home cooking enthusiast, Sausage Sage provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and storing your favorite sausage recipes.

It's not on the Play store because of Google's ridiculous testing requirements, so sharing it for free. Feel free to donate to my PayPal, usuede@gmail.com
